query_tracking
==============


This is my first real dynamic webproject. Uses Python-Flask.

Its original purpose is a sort of ticketing-tracking system for work.
Currenty I work as a DBA so we are going to use it to dump historical query information from the system tables into a separate DB. This way we can assign performance tuning jobs to people, keep track of who is doing what and which fixes have been implemented already. It's to make our lives a bit esaier basically. 

Could have used a ready-made solution, but then it wouldn't be that easy to integrate real performance metrics of the original queries, plus I was just realy happy to have a webproject finally :)

Charts and graphs of performance metrics and such are in planning as well.
